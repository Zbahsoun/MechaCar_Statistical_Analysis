# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Statistics and R

## Overview of the project
Jeremy has been working with AutosRUs for 10 years, because of his experience and knowledge he was selected to lead the Data Analytics team to conduct a statistical study, a quantitative metric and to present a clear interpretation of the results. Jeremy will be performing statistical tests using R programming language, in addition to investing his critical thinking skills to help him propose a study design that includes hypotheses and different variables analysis to make the manufacturing process even better. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The below image shows the prediction of the linear regression to predict MPG

- The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance are the two variables that will provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The p-value for this model is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%, this is an evidence that we can reject our null hypothesis. 
- The r-squared value in this linear model is 0.7149, which means that there is almost 71% of all MPG prototypes will be effective.
